## Description
This website was submitted as a final group project when the authors were training towards a Tech Industry Gold Credential in software development, receiving their training through FDM Group. The project is a Barbie themed e-commerce website that sells Barbie themed clothing. The website has functionality to explore through the website pages showing particular collections of outfits and items. Refer to the initial commit made to the main branch to gain an idea of what the authors achieved in 4 days before submitting the project. This repository now serves for the authors to continue working on what was built in those 4 days. 

## Getting Started
To run the project locally:
- Navigate to the directory named `frontend`.
- Run `npm i` (or `npm insall`) and then run `npm start` to load the frontend. This can be confirmed by visiting `http://localhost:3000` via a browser.
- In the `backend` directory, navigate to the `BarbieEcommerceWebsiteApiApplication.java` file (`src/main/java/com/fdmgroup/api/BarbieEcommerceWebsiteApiApplication.java`) and click `Run` (this applies if you are using VS Code in a other IDEs like Eclipse, simply right click on the project and run the project as a Spring Boot Application).
- After refreshing the local server, the data from the API should now load to the frontend.

## Project Status
WIP (work in progress): not all desired functionality has been achieved, this will be improved upon over time.
### DoD
The e-commerce website is considered “done” when it is functional, responsive, and meets the following criteria: all core features, including product listing, shopping basket, user registration, login and logout functionality are implemented and functioning correctly. The user interface is polished, with intuitive navigation menus, well-designed pages and smooth transitions. The website is at least 80% tested, and the code is well documented.

## Roadmap
- Altering resizing of webage to make it suitable for all screen sizes
- Adding images to cart
- Adding wishlist functionality in front- and back-end
- Updating tests to ensure they all work
- Adding an admin side to contribute to the addition of new items/maintenance of an inventory
- Ensuring all tests pass for all controller and service classes (code coverage is currently 93.8%)

## Team Organisation
Whilst working on this project, the authors used Scrum and Agile principles to organise and prioritise their tasks. This included daily scrums, a scrum retrospective, working in sprints, and composing a product backlog. Kanban boards and product backlogs were managed using Jira Software.
